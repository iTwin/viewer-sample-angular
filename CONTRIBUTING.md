## Creating Issues and Enhancements

Have you identified a reproducible problem in this code? Have a feature requests? Please create an Issue, but first make sure that you search the work items to make sure that it has not been entered yet. If you find your issue already exists, please add relevant comments or just a thumbs up to let us know that more people face this issue.

### Writing Good Bug Reports and Feature Requests

File a single issue per problem and feature request. Do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.

Do not add your issue as a comment to an existing issue unless it's for the identical input. Many issues look similar, but have different causes.

The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful at reproducing the issue and finding a fix.

Please include the following with each issue:

- Version of the package
- Your operating system
- Reproducible steps (1... 2... 3...) that cause the issue
- What you expected to see, versus what you actually saw
- Images, animations, or a link to a video showing the issue occurring
- A code snippet that demonstrates the issue or a link to a code repository the developers can easily pull down to recreate the issue locally

## Pull Requests

We follow the normal [GitHub pull request workflow](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) to ensure that all code changes in this repository are code reviewed and all tests pass. This means that there will be a number of reviewers that formally review and sign off for changes. Reviewers should check for redundancy, optimization, stylization, and standardization in each changeset. While we will try to keep this repository as collaborative and open-source as possible, it must also be reliable.

Every change must be tested with proper unit tests.

### Code Change Workflow

1. Make source code changes on a new Git branch.
2. Add unit tests.
3. Ensure unit tests pass when run locally: `npm run test`.
4. Test changes locally `npm start`
5. Commit your changes.
6. Publish changes to the branch and open a pull request.
